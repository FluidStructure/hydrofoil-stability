## Hydroelastic Stability Analysis of an Inverted T Hydrofoil

Matlab/Octave code for the calculation of Eignemodes / Eigenvectors of an inverted "T" hydrofoil at high speed.

This code uses a lumped-mass Finite Element Method tightly coupled with a Potential flow solution for the fluid in order to calculate the resonance frequency for linear perturbations to the foil while moving at high speed through the water.
